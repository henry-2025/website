This is my personal website. It's a simple blog site with some other bells and whistles and it relies on htmx for frontend reactivity. Other blog frameworks are cool and easy to setup, but there is not much room for creative freedom once the basic functionality of posting and updating is achieved. Considering this only took a little extra time to write and has so much more flexibility, it is certainly a win in my books.
