    <strong>I</strong> want to think that my running story begins long before I actually
    ever ran without the intention of getting from one place to another. 10-year-old
    me got to observe my mom&rsquo;s daily routine of running to work through the
    SoCal wilderness and then flying to Boston for some weird event once each year.
    I think I tried a Gu gel or two and got the sense that light shoes with vibrant
    colors and clothes made out of dri-fit material were an important criteria for
    success, but beyond that I mostly learned that the sport was a large part of
    her identity. I came to associate the sport with her strengths&mdash;honesty,
    consistency, and kindness. It was only until after getting to college when all
    of my running nerd friends made me aware of the huge athletic pedigree that I
    had supporting my career, so thanks for the help and inspiration, Mom.

    Relatively recently, I also learned that my dad swam in college. He brings
    way more athletic credit to the table than I have so far recognized him for.
    It&rsquo;s always been in the back of my mind to eventually switch over to
    the pool, but there are a few more boxes on my running bucket list that I
    need to check before I commit to that. Thanks, Pop.
</p>

<p>
    Every sport that I played while growing up was frustrating as hell. At the
    time, I think this came from some lacking skill in temper management coupled
    with the unrealistic expectation that I had to be the best in everything
    that I picked up. Not being from a family that watched professional sports
    also left me with no higher inspiration or general love for the sports that
    I tried doing. There was a Little League summer, a basketball summer, many
    seasons on the middle school surf team, and then finally tennis by the end
    of middle school. All these were trending in the direction of teaching me
    that it&rsquo;s OK to be average and maybe just enjoy doing the sport as a
    physical activity or by relishing in your own improvement from one year to
    the next.
</p>

<p>
    As a freshman in high school, my mom signed me up for a cross country
    season. I don&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;s ever forced me to do anything like
    most moms would. She absolutely has a way of guilt tripping me into doing
    things and this was certainly one of those instances. I can still remember
    her saying &ldquo;come on, it&rsquo;ll be really fun. Look at how much I
    enjoy it!&rdquo; and thinking that there&rsquo;s no way it would be cool to
    do something that parents view as entertaining. <figure>
        <img src="10-years-running/hoka.jpg" alt="first race ever" />
        <figcaption>
            Picture of my first race ever, probably my best race ever
        </figcaption>
    </figure>
    The following two weeks of summer training served to prove me right as I clopped
    around in the two-sizes-too-large used running shoes that my dad said would serve
    me well, got some light shin splints, and experienced soreness for the first
    time in my life. We ran maybe 3 miles a day, suffered through drills in the mid-afternoon
    summer heat, and I developed a new appreciation for the single chilled water
    fountain in the high school gym. I quickly developed a sense for my talent though.
    And I try very hard to hold onto this memory for when I try new things now. I
    think it&rsquo;s good to remember what it&rsquo;s like for something to feel
    natural. Not everything is like that and it is good to understand what those
    things are. I ended up winning pretty much every Frosh-soph race I entered and
    immediately dropped out of the tennis team, which I replaced with track. I finished
    my freshman year, almost making CIF Southern Section Finals in the 1600m. So
    yes, trying to disprove my mom&rsquo;s point about running being fun became harder
    and harder each week. Unfortunately, this was mostly because this was the first
    time I had experienced what I was like to win at something.
</p>

<p>
    I ended up dropping more things to focus on sports over the next year of
    high school. I stop playing in jazz band. I interacted less with friends who
    did not run. I started to see my coach and older teammates as better mentors
    and role models than teachers and fellow classmates. I can see why this was
    concerning to my dad, who I think has a very neutral perspective on the
    sport and maybe a negative one on sports in general from his past
    experiences. With so much time going into one activity, it is important to
    consider how that activity shapes you. If you&rsquo;re drinking Kool-Aid
    with the wrong people, it can be lethal.
</p>

<p>
    The rest of high school can mostly be ignored except for junior year when
    something happened that gave me a new sense of attachment to the sport. I
    ran the Arcadia invitational that year in one of their B-tier 3200 heats and
    set up pretty impressive PR off of following and out-kicking a sophomore
    runner from Newbury Park by the name of Nico Young. <figure

        <figcaption>Nico Young, Billie Eilish enjoyer</figcaption>
    </figure>
    He ended up taking the state title in that event as a sophomore later that 2017
    season, granting me major bragging rights to all of my high school teammates
    at the time. My goal was to come back the following year and give him a run for
    his money. I think that&rsquo;s about the most that I&rsquo;ve overestimated
    my athletic abilities to date. The significance of that achievement has compounded
    over time as he&rsquo;s progressed to being the current American record holder
    in the 10,000 m and member of Team USA in 2024.
</p>

<p>
    That same year, a coach named John Goldhammer reached out to me asking if I
    wanted to visit his team at the Claremont Colleges in eastern LA. After a
    two-day recruiting trip spending time with several of his lunatic athletes
    who mostly went to Claremont McKenna College, I was totally sold on going to
    school in Claremont to run miles and drink beers. The unfortunate oversight
    I made was in applying to get my engineering degree at <i
        >Harvey Mudd College</i
    >, which lies just one block North of Claremont McKenna. Social skills here
    are less abundant than I experienced on my tour, but people there still run
    lots of miles and drink beers. In the end, I guess it all worked out and
    that ended up scheduling the next four years of my running career. This
    started in Fall of 2019 when the world was so innocent, the tech job market
    was unperturbed by global economic shifts, and most Americans had probably
    never engaged in mortal combat over a roll of toilet paper. I remember being
    intimidated by my teammates who were mostly faster and better looking than I
    was and by coach Goldy, with his growing track record of fake-strangling his
    athletes.
</p>

<p>
    I set some impressive marks that season and got a taste of what I
    would&rsquo;ve learned from my college experience had things continued
    without a global pandemic. From my perspective, the team was together, the
    team was successful, and the mentorship of my seniors was the primary reason
    for my improvement over those four months of racing. People who were much
    faster than me seemed to acknowledge my potential. The casual &ldquo;good
    job out there today, Big Dog&rdquo; or nod from the seniors at team
    functions made me feel like they cared about both our friendship and my
    success in their group. Not one or the other. I can imagine this is a major
    frustration for anyone on this team who is now in the professional world. It
    can&rsquo;t be like this in a competitive, partially zero-sum game.
    It&rsquo;s also surprising to me that this seemingly can&rsquo;t exist
    without devoting your entire life to a single activity&mdash;to drink the
    Kool-Aid, so to say. I&rsquo;m simultaneously very grateful to had this
    experience, but also frustrated that I have this to compare to many future
    teams I will work on or compete with.

    </figure>
    Nonetheless, that half a year maintains in my mind as the perfect season&mdash;one
    without flaws, worry and just growth. People sometimes say that there is no growth
    without struggle, and even after having seen both experiences, I am uncertain
    whether it is one or the other. Come Spring a few weeks into the start of our
    season, we get kicked off of campus with two-days&rsquo; notice, and before that,
    I remember sitting on a bench with all 50 or 60 of my teammates, getting word
    from our athletic director that we would no longer be in person teammates for
    that season. I can&rsquo;t remember feeling more emotional in my life with a
    group of people I had only really known for six months. None of us at the time
    knew that our lives would be placed on hold for years. None of us knew how much
    the world was going to change once it all started back up again. In those two
    days, I think my gut feel was as true as it&rsquo;s ever been. The world and
    running were bound to change for me, and for everyone.
</p>

<p>
    Moving back home and finishing up that semester, keeping the runs in just
    for mental clarity and little else rapidly changed my relationship with the
    sport. There were no highs of winning, there were no lows of the team having
    a shitty day, just the sound of my feet on the completely empty bike path
    and the miles ticking up. Running probably allowed me to exist without
    depression in this state, but I think it also masked the reality of what
    everyone in college at this time was losing&mdash;the ability to connect
    with physically present people. This is where I understand that running can
    be dangerous and that it allows people to isolate like this in a very
    peaceful state. It remains something that I remind myself of when a
    day-to-day life of only office work and solo runs doesn&rsquo;t seem that
    initially harmful.
</p>

<p>
    One day, I was working out at a track near my family&rsquo;s home when an
    older guy wearing Ray-Bans and face cloaked in a cotton mask approached me
    asking if I was training for something. His name was Ed Italo, coach at the
    Thatcher School in the small, Los Angeles getaway town of Ojai, CA. I also
    recognized him from our league meets a couple years back. His athlete, Colin
    Kirkpatrick, had been a nemesis of mine on the track. Ed would coach Colin
    to sit back throughout the race and and then pass in the last hundred
    meters, a brilliantly simple race tactic but not one that I particularly
    appreciated at the time. Ed was a cool guy though. He had two sons, he
    played Burning Man sets as he rolled around in an FJ Cruiser, and he had a
    vastly different perspective on running than any of my past coaches. He made
    me aware of this over the following two years that he on-and-off coached me.
    In Ed&rsquo;s frame of things, track is a perfectionist&rsquo;s sport.
    Obsess over everything you can and do everything in a particular way and you
    will be good. You will be <i>the best</i>.
</p>

<p>
    Running with Ed was a great experience and there are absolutely kids who
    have grown by buying into it, but for me the Kool-Aid became tough to drink
    after a few years. There were superficial things about the training that did
    not click. My then five-year background was primarily in longer-distance
    events while his vision of meaningful running only extended to four laps
    around the track. The actual content of his training consisted almost
    entirely of speed strength and no endurance development. However, the main
    friction point between us was caused by my emerging value of balance.
    Ed&rsquo;s philosophy about being a great athlete is a very easy conclusion
    to draw from the small sample size of only the most successful people in
    each field or pursuit. But I think it is a false conclusion given the
    reality that there are more people in the world than things to be the best
    at. However it was becoming evident that I never did my best when I thought
    this way about my goals. I often performed best under the condition of
    balance. I believe it is very likely for this to apply to the vast majority
    of people who achieve mastery in something. Balance and optimality are in
    many ways equivalent and I realized that although I wasn&rsquo;t trying to
    pursue being the best in the world, I was willing to relentlessly pursue my
    own potential. I was simply not willing to risk my fulfillment and love that
    I had built for this sport to test Ed&rsquo;s theory.
</p>

<p>
    Over the semesters that we were not on campus, my friends and I lived in
    Pagosa Springs, Colorado and Eugene, Oregon partially because they were
    great places to run also partially because we had no idea how much rain we
    were going to get during the tail end of Oregon winter. It seemed that my
    friends had built very different relationships with running during their
    first few months of remote school. Some had started running trails as a
    means of observing natural beauty. Others had clearly found that they just
    couldn&rsquo;t run alone, but I was still very embedded in the habit of
    running to isolate, or perhaps to comfort myself from the feeling of
    isolation. This period made a lot of good runners exceptional, and probably
    made others realize that there were more enjoyable things in life.
</p>

<p>
    The running world had changed in so many ways we got back to our first
    practice of 2021. Goldhammer had retired since his last hurrah over a year
    ago and in his place stood what some might call his inverse&mdash;a woman
    who didn&rsquo;t say much beyond a few directions in an Eastern European
    accent to clarify that days&rsquo; workout. Getting to know Marina, our new
    coach, was awesome. Super shoes had hit the consumer running market
    overnight and records were starting to fall left and right. And I started
    approaching the sport with a new level of ambition, inspired by Ed&rsquo;s
    promise of greatness.
</p>

<p>
    This was the season where I discovered what it means to believe in myself.
    To my frustration, I started running some of my slowest college times after
    having trained harder than ever before. Pushing through took a leap of faith
    against the sadness and resignation that I felt towards something that I
    loved dearly. What was important in this situation was just taking a step
    back to collect thoughts and feelings. My gut instinct of training harder
    would have only worsened the problem, which I later discovered was iron
    deficiency. My alternative zero-thought response of quitting the team that
    season altogether was just as entitled. It took a few hard conversations
    with Marina and some doctors visits to set aside my pride and just finish
    the season as best as I could. To my pleasant surprise, things turned
    around. And they didn&rsquo;t just turn around; they changed fundamentally. <figure
        style="float: left"

        />

    By the end of that season, I went from my slowest ever college time to a
    conference title and a third place finish at nationals. I realize how lucky
    I am to be able to say that because things do not work out like this for
    everyone. The question of long-term contentment is much more the focus to
    the person who gets chronic stress fractures and is unable to train for half
    of their career. We all fight our own battles and come away with unique
    nuggets of wisdom.
</p>

<p>
    That year was an emotional and performance climax of college running for me.
    This was in no small part because the takeaways from that season were still
    processing and the philosophy that informed training and lifestyle was far
    from perfect. After graduating, starting my job search, and moving back
    home, running resumed its supportive role in life by providing me with
    community as well as something to wake up to each ady. There was no
    template, no more running career ambitions, it was now just a hobby that I
    continued to do for enjoyment.
</p>

<p>
    After moving to Seattle and starting to work, I have more or less continued
    to enhance the quality of my engagements with running as a hobby. The local
    performance running group Club Northwest provides a majority of the training
    resources and community that I am now part of. While it could just be me
    running out there in the rain, I concede now that running is something that
    is better done with others. The cherry on top is that my ability and skills
    have continued to develop despite no longer having the intensity that I once
    believed was necessary to be good. The long career in this sport is
    evidently a result of consistency and continued enjoyment of putting in the
    effort, balancing the load, and stepping back once in a while to appreciate
    the way you&rsquo;ve come.
</p>

<p>
    The metaphor in this title still needs to be mentioned one last time. Running had
    a very influential, almost dominating effect on my life, and it is now just
    something that I put time into more or less at-will. A lot of us fear
    commitment as this thing that will have a drastic and uncontrollable impact
    on our lives, which is true if we are inexperienced and fail to understand
    what these effects are in advance. Being able to think critically about
    these impacts is what lets us decide whether a thing or person is worth
    investing this much time in. It is not the level of commitment or the amount
    of time that should scare us and instead how the results differ from our
    goals or values. Paradoxically, the things that can shape life like this are
    also the most rewarding. When I think of all the places that running has
    taken me and all of the paths that could have been explored, I find that
    faith in myself and honest judgement tends to work out for the right ones. There
    will always be an opportunity to drink Kool-Aid, and if you choose to, make sure
    you are doing it for the right reasons.
</p>

<p>So long,</p>
