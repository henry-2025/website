    <p>
        My name is Jonathan &ldquo;Henry&rdquo; Pick. I am a recent graduate of
        Harvey Mudd College, a small liberal-arts school in Southern California
        where I majored in computer science and math. Over my Summers as an
        undergrad, I was in a physics lab, I did some work at a tech company as
        a backend engineer, and I had another couple of internships at a medical
        instruments manufacturer. Right now, I am directing my career towards
        becoming an ML engineer and researcher.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is this looming doubt that my interested in fields closely aligned
        with generative AI is just fueled by the market craze, however. There is
        also the inevitable truth that the pipeline into ML is very bottlenecked
        for new grads with no industry experience. These points probably deserve
        some concern, but I know that with enough sincere interest and and
        effort, I can overcome them. That is what I am trying to do now. This
        mostly entails doing everything I can to know the ins and outs of the
        engineering components and finding meaningful research that I can do
        independently.
    </p>
    <p>
        My interest in this field started a couple years back when a friend gave
        me his old copy of Kevin Murphy's <i
            >Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</i
        >. You open the thing and it is literally like four college courses of
        linear algebra, statistics, probability, and decision theory packed into
        one book. The content was incrediby dense, nothing that I could sit down
        and read for more than a few pages at a time, but I got hooked once I
        read the first chapter. It took me <i>months</i> of reading every day to
        finish that book, but I did it eventually. And I swear, it really did change
        the way I saw the world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Perhaps I didn't sieze the day in the way that I should have, because by
        the end of my undergrad, I had no idea how I would pursue this interest
        in my career. I had not worked in any related research labs, I didn't
        have many friends who were planning on working in this field, and I
        hadn't ever thought about applying to grad school. The only thing that
        one could really do in my position was to start working on something
        independently, so that's what I started doing.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what's next? Computer vision in deep learning and cognetive science
        is one of my strongest interests within the field moment and if you know
        a thing or two about ML, you probably want to have a significant
        academic background. Going back to school is a serious consideration and
        my goal is to eventually hitch a ride with a good grad program over the
        next couple of years. However, I am also looking for work that will pay
        because money is nice to have sometimes. If you are reading this and
        work at a company that is hiring, by all means, contact me.

    <h2>Another little thing</h2>
    <p>
        I hate to conform to the college student athlete stereotype, but I
        should say that I do. Athletics is a big part of my identity and it is
        where most of my accomplishment lies over the past four years. Starting
        in high school, I ran for my schools' cross country and track teams,
        accumulating something like 16 competitive seasons if you exclude the
        ones that we lost to COVID. I'll brag a little and say that I had some
        pretty good runs: 4:06 in the mile, 14:01 in the 5k, 8:11 in the 3k and
        23:40 in the XC 8k were my PRs. You can look at my stats a little more
        and realize that I was not famed for my consistent performances,
        however.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are many who have tried, unsuccessfully, to continue living out
        the glory days of d3 running into their early professional careers. I
        choose not to focus on this statistic as I intend to be one of the few
        notable exceptions. It's big talk, but just watch me butt heads with all
        of those college hot shots in the open-entry track meets this coming
        season. I can be the most intense hobby jogger you've ever seen.
        Outcomes aside, I know that my running career is not over and I think
        there are still quite a few good miles left in the legs. All of my
        closest friends, many of my best memories, some of the greatest feelings
        in my life have come out of this sport. There is really no reason to
        give it up right now while it's still hot on my plate.
