<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Henry</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to my blog where I post about engineering and outdoor endurance
  sports. I try to keep a light, comedic tone in these articles, similar to how
  I might come off in person.
</p>
<p>
  I grew up and went to school in southern California. I now live in Seattle,
  Washington where there is a bit more water and a bit less sunshine. If you
  live in the area, you&rsquo;ll likely see me running or hanging out in one of
  the city&rsquo;s many coffee shops.
