<h3>Henry</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to my blog where I post my rants about engineering, endurance sports,
  and music. I try to keep a light, comedic tone in these articles, similar to how I might come off if you were to interact with me as a friend.

  Hey, my name is Henry and this is
  where I keep blogs and other portfolio-related things of mine. I work as a
  software engineer in my day job, but I spend some of my free time also working
  on my own coding projects because I guess that is just something I like to do.
  Aside from that, I am an avid runner and an aspiring household cook.

  I grew up and went to school in southern California. I now live in Seattle,
  Washington where there is a bit more water and a bit less sunshine.
