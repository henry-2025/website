    <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    My name is (Jonathan) Henry Pick. I am a recent graduate of Harvey Mudd
    College, a small liberal-arts school in Southern California where I majored
    in computer science and math. Over my Summers as an undergrad, I was in a
    physics lab, I did some work at a tech company as a backend engineer, and I
    had another couple of internships at a medical instruments manufacturer.
    Right now, I am directing my career towards becoming an ML engineer and
    researcher.
  </p>
  <p>
    My interest in this field started a couple years ago when a friend gave me
    his old copy of Kevin Murphy's <i
      >Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective</i
    >. You open the thing and it is literally like four college courses of
    linear algebra, statistics, probability, and decision theory packed into a
    thousand pages. The content was incredibly dense, nothing that I could sit
    down and read for more than a few pages at a time, but I got hooked once I
    read the first chapter. It took discipline and lots of rereading to finish
    that book with a solid understanding of it all, but I did it eventually. And
    I swear, it really did change the way I saw the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was fascinated by one particular thing in this grand theory of data,
    decision-making and representation: it was connected to our biological
    machinery in uncountable ways. I had no prior interest in the biological or
    cognitive sciences, but that is because I viewed them as being distinct from
    math and computation. One deals mostly with the proof of correctness while
    the other focuses on understanding heuristic behaviors of very large and
    complicated systems. In contrast with this conception, machine learning has
    been able to assign a name and representation to many of these things that
    we call "intuition". That made it one of the most accessible and also
    unbelievable of the sciences that I had interacted with. Another thing that
    struck me was the level of nuance and debate afoot in the surrounding
    academic community. I mean, nuance and debate exist everywhere in science.
    It is very hard, however, to find a field where people are still trying to
    understand the very fundamental methods and principles of concern. For
    example, we still don't have a good definition for what it means to memorize
    a distribution of data versus understanding it. We also don't know whether
    or not such a definition even matters. All of these qualities seem to
    promote a highly creative application of the science, something I valued
    above all other things in my search for that one ideal field of interest.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then sometime in the last year, LLMs hit the streets and the meme investors
    found a new darling in the market: generative AI. Job openings for ML
    engineers and researchers became increasingly competitive. But honestly,
    that doesn't push me away because I do believe my interest for working in
    the field is strong and genuine. I still have little industry experience,
    but through independent work, I think it is possible to make myself just as
    qualified as those who have worked in the field professionally. And that is
    what I am doing now.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what's next? Well, finding a job is sort of a big item on my plate
    because money is nice to have sometimes. If you are reading this and you
    work at a company that is hiring someone with my interests, by all means,
    contact me! Going back to school is also a serious consideration and my goal
    is to eventually hitch a ride with a good grad program over the next couple
    of years. If you have any interesting research projects that you would like
    to talk about, I would also love to get in touch. My particular research
    interests are in computer vision and cognitive science.

  <h2>Other things about me</h2>
  <p>
    I hate to conform to the college student athlete stereotype, but I should
    say that I do. Athletics is a big part of my identity and it is where most
    of my accomplishment lies over the past four years of college. Starting in
    high school, I ran for my schools' cross country and track teams,
    accumulating something like 16 competitive seasons if you exclude the ones
    that we lost to COVID. I'll brag a little and say that I had some pretty
    good runs: 4:06 in the mile, 14:01 in the 5k, 8:11 in the 3k and 23:40 in
    the XC 8k were my PRs.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many who have tried, unsuccessfully, to continue living out the
    glory days of D3 running into their early professional careers. I choose not
    to focus on this statistic as I intend to be one of the few notable
    exceptions! It's big talk, but just watch me butt heads with all of those
    college hot shots in the open-entry track meets this coming season. I can be
    the most intense hobby jogger you've ever seen. Outcomes aside, I know that
    my running career is not over and I think there are still quite a few good
    miles left in the legs. All of my closest friends, many of my best memories,
    some of the greatest feelings in my life have come out of this sport. There
    is really no reason to give it up right now while it's still hot on my
    plate.
