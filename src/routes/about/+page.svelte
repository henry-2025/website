<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
  Hey, my name is Henry and this is where I keep blogs and other
  portfolio-related things of mine. I work as a software engineer in my day job,
  but I spend some of my free time also working on my own coding projects
  because I guess that is just something I like to do. Aside from that, I am an
  avid runner and an aspiring household cook.
</p>
<p>
  I grew up and went to school in southern California. I now live in Seattle,
  Washington where there is a bit more water and a bit less sunshine.
